            <p class="description">A demanding computing project performed in a team and under the supervision of computer science faculty. 
              Students will design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements. 
              Students work in groups of 3-5 and will follow the Agile SCRUM project management methodology. All projects are unstructured 
              with no predetermined solution. The scope includes proposing a project, identifying computing and user requirements, and 
              prototyping a solution. A proposal, progress reports, and a public seminar are required.</p>

            <p class="description">This course introduces the student to the fundamentals of computer security. Foundational concepts such
               as confidentiality, integrity, and availability are discussed in the context of both designing systems and evaluating 
               existing systems for vulnerabilities. Cryptography is explored as a tool that can be applied to many aspects of computer 
               security. Theoretical discussions of security principles are enriched by examples from real world systems and protocols.</p>
